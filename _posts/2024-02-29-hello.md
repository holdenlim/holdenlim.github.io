## Welcome!
To my all-new web site. To commemorate this occasion, I am answering a selection of Frequently Asked Questions which have never been asked to me ever in my life.
##### Why would you make a site like this?
I want to have a link that I can give people to contact me for business purposes. This website has some info about me, and I'm going to publish my resume onto here soon. I might also use the blog feature to post comics, short stories, and drawings.
##### I see you're using al-folio. Isn't that for professors and stuff?
That's correct. I am not a professor of any sort, nor will I become one at any point in the near future. However, this theme meets all my needs and then some. I had to remove pages like students and teaching material, but otherwise it works and looks great.
##### What is the point of an FAQ when no one has ever asked you a question?
That's the best part. There's not. I'm mainly just testing out the blog aspect of al-folio.

Well, that's the end of my first blog post. I may return soon, or I may never return. I have absolutely no idea.
